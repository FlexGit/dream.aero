	<h3 style="line-height: 1.3em;font-weight: bold;text-align: center;">ASSISTANCE WITH AEROPHOBIA AND TRAVEL-RELATED ANXIETY</h3>
	<p>Many people are afraid of flying. This is a normal reaction when placed in an uncomfortable environment. Most people can easily keep these fears under control, but when fear takes hold, you experience what is known as a phobia. Phobias have a profoundly negative effect on our lives, and they must be addressed as serious concerns. Phobias are often detached from objective reality, and in many instances are irrational. Someone with aerophobia may have never flown before, but nevertheless, that person may be fearful. Comparably, they may be aware that riding in a car is much more dangerous, yet, they still may be unable to overcome their phobia.</p>
	<p><img src="{{ asset('img/aerofobia.jpg') }}" alt="" width="100%" height="auto"></p>
	<p>Unfortunately, aerophobia occurs in many people. According to some researchers, up to 20% of people choose not to fly because of this condition. This is happening at the time when moving quickly and across large distances is essential in everyday life. Many types of activities and lifestyles rely on fast, efficient and most importantly, safe travel.</p>
	<p>Often, people do not seem to overcome their phobias without getting some form of help. Although many people take medication or drink alcohol, panic attacks happen time and time again. Psychologists have developed methods for overcoming aerophobia, which allow people to return to normal life and stop imposing travel limitations on themselves.</p>
	<p>One of the most effective methods for overcoming aerophobia involves virtual reality simulation, such as practicing on a flight simulator. The idea is to provide exposure in a controlled environment, followed by vigorous exercises, in an effort to overcome the fear. People are able to manage their panic attacks more successfully knowing that things are under control. To some extent, this is similar to the difference of what you experience being the driver versus the passenger.</p>

	<p>The cockpit of our flight simulator is situated on a moving platform that fully replicates the physical dynamics of a flight in full detail. As you accelerate during takeoff you will experience every bump on the runway and you will feel the power of liftoff and the climb. The platform responds to every move the pilot makes and accurately portrays each and every in-flight condition (roll-offs, turbulence, etc.).</p>
	<p><img src="{{ asset('img/visual.jpg') }}" alt="" width="100%" height="auto"></p>
	<p>Our platform is powered by a high-output hydraulic control system. The full motion cockpit, vivid visuals and real sounds create the most realistic imitation of a flight aboard a Boeing 737.</p>

Learn the complexities of flying a plane aboard a simulator that provides a very lifelike experience. Our cockpit simulator is an exact copy of a real cockpit, and all equipment found on board is identical to the instruments found on a real aircraft.&nbsp;</p>
	<p><strong>COCKPIT&nbsp;</strong></p>
	<p>You will take up the captain’s seat, and your flight instructor will take the place of the first officer. The instrument panel will not have the new fashionable joystick controls. It was designed in the timeless classical style with a traditional steering wheel for manual piloting.&nbsp;</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>All levers, switches, and devices in the&nbsp;cockpit&nbsp;simulator fully correspond to those of a&nbsp;real plane’s cockpit. Flight instruments allow the pilot to control the plane’s path, manage the engines,&nbsp;flaps,&nbsp;and other piloting systems. Learn to operate this impeccably designed hi-tech aircraft. You will&nbsp;surely&nbsp;enjoy your new role as the master of the skies.&nbsp;</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Use your onboard computer panel to enter your flight data and check all the systems of your aircraft. Use the autopilot panel to set&nbsp;the parameters of your flight. There are numerous knobs and switches on the overhead panel&nbsp;which&nbsp;are used to control lighting, start the engines,&nbsp;and control&nbsp;the hydraulics&nbsp;as well as&nbsp;the air conditioning system.&nbsp;</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Displays in the cockpit show the main parameters you will need to pilot the airplane, monitor the&nbsp;engines and all&nbsp;systems, and to navigate your flight.&nbsp;</p>
